Data processing stages
Stage 1: single spike properties for each cell
	-spike times
	-classified cell type
	-probability of classification within session
	-waveform feature values

Stage 2: spike train properties for each cell
	-firing rate
	-autocorrelogram
	-isi distribution
	-cross correlograms to all other cells in array
	--multiple time scales

Stage 3: network properties
	-distribution of firing rates
	-E-E and I-I correlation vs space
	--multiple time scales
	--multiple states


stage model allows 
-having information for yet anticipated questions
-one authoritative source of processed data 
--reduces probability of bugs exponentially
